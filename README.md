# AES Block Cipher – Educational Notebook

This repository contains a **didactic Jupyter notebook** on the **AES-128 block cipher**, focused on understanding how the algorithm works internally and how its security properties emerge.

## What you’ll find
- AES internal structure (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey)
- Key expansion overview
- Modes of operation (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB)
- Simple experiments on **diffusion and confusion** using bit flips and Hamming distance
